<strong>Combat Defined</strong>
<ul>What is combat?
    <li>A fight or contest between individuals or a group</li>
    <li>usually involves swords, fists, or guns</li>
  </ul>
  <p> In DnD,
  The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns.
  A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
  During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn.
  The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter,
  when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the
  fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
